# Security Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of the Sora Watermark Remover tool, including vulnerability assessments and security best practices implemented.

## Security Audit Results

### CodeQL Analysis
Date: October 26, 2024
Status: ✅ SECURE (with false positives explained)

### Vulnerabilities Addressed

#### 1. XSS Protection - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: User-provided file metadata (filename, file type) was being inserted into HTML without escaping.

**Fix**: 
- Added `escapeHtml()` helper function to sanitize all user-provided content
- All file metadata is now properly escaped before display
- Implementation:
```javascript
function escapeHtml(text) {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = text;
    return div.innerHTML;
}
```

**Affected Code**:
- File information display (line 122-128)
- Filename usage in HTML context

#### 2. Filename Sanitization - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: Filenames used in download attribute could contain malicious characters.

**Fix**:
- Sanitize filenames by removing potentially dangerous characters
- Pattern: `/[<>:"/\\|?*]/g` replaced with underscore
- Implementation:
```javascript
const sanitizedName = currentFile.name
    .replace(/\.[^/.]+$/, '')
    .replace(/[<>:"/\\|?*]/g, '_');
```

### CodeQL False Positives

The following alerts are **false positives** and do not represent actual security vulnerabilities:

#### Alert 1: Video Source Assignment (line 146)
```javascript
originalVideo.src = videoURL;
```
**Why it's safe**: `videoURL` is a blob URL created by `URL.createObjectURL()`, which generates internal browser URLs like `blob:http://localhost:8080/uuid`. These cannot contain XSS payloads.

#### Alert 2: Video Source Assignment (line 176)
```javascript
processedVideo.src = processedURL;
```
**Why it's safe**: Same as Alert 1 - blob URLs are safe and cannot be exploited for XSS.

#### Alert 3: Anchor href Assignment (line 274)
```javascript
a.href = url;
```
**Why it's safe**: Setting href to a blob URL for download purposes. The blob URL is browser-generated and safe. Additionally, the download attribute limits the URL usage to file downloads only.

### Additional Security Measures

#### 1. Client-Side Only Processing ✅
- **No server uploads**: All video processing happens in browser
- **No external data transmission**: Videos never leave user's device
- **Privacy by design**: No backend infrastructure to compromise

#### 2. Content Security ✅
- **File type validation**: Only video MIME types accepted
- **File size limits**: 500MB maximum to prevent DoS
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive checks on all user inputs

#### 3. No Tracking or Analytics ✅
- **No cookies**: Tool doesn't use cookies
- **No external scripts**: Only CDN for FFmpeg.wasm library
- **No analytics**: No tracking pixels or analytics services

#### 4. Resource Protection ✅
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of blob URLs
- **Resource limits**: File size restrictions
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure without exposing internals

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Sanitization
✅ HTML escaping for all user-provided content
✅ Filename sanitization
✅ MIME type validation
✅ File size validation

### 2. Safe APIs
✅ `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` where possible
✅ `URL.createObjectURL()` for safe blob handling
✅ Proper cleanup with `URL.revokeObjectURL()`

### 3. No Dangerous Patterns
✅ No `eval()` or `Function()` constructors
✅ No dynamic script injection
✅ No inline event handlers
✅ No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` equivalents

### 4. CORS and CSP Ready
The tool can be enhanced with Content Security Policy headers:
```
Content-Security-Policy: 
    default-src 'self'; 
    script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://unpkg.com; 
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
    worker-src 'self' blob:;
    child-src blob:;
```

## Potential Future Enhancements

### 1. Subresource Integrity (SRI)
Add integrity checks for CDN resources:
```html
<script 
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ffmpeg/ffmpeg@0.12.6/dist/umd/ffmpeg.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-..."
    crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

### 2. Service Worker
Implement service worker for:
- Offline functionality
- CDN fallback
- Enhanced caching

### 3. Web Crypto API
For future features requiring cryptography:
- Secure random number generation
- Hash verification
- Digital signatures

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated ✅
- **XSS Attacks**: Input sanitization prevents script injection
- **File Upload Attacks**: Type and size validation
- **Resource Exhaustion**: File size limits and memory management
- **Privacy Leaks**: Client-side only processing

### Threats Outside Scope
- **Physical Security**: User's device security is their responsibility
- **Browser Vulnerabilities**: Relies on browser security
- **FFmpeg.wasm Vulnerabilities**: Trusts upstream library
- **Social Engineering**: Cannot prevent user errors

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance ✅
- **No data collection**: Nothing to store or process
- **No tracking**: No personal data gathered
- **No cookies**: No persistent storage
- **Data minimization**: Only processes what user provides
- **Right to erasure**: User controls all data locally

### Best Practices Alignment ✅
- **OWASP Top 10**: Addresses relevant vulnerabilities
- **CWE/SANS Top 25**: No dangerous patterns
- **Mozilla Web Security Guidelines**: Follows recommendations

## Security Contacts

For security concerns:
1. **Public Issues**: For non-sensitive security suggestions
2. **Private Disclosure**: For serious vulnerabilities (contact repository owner)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Contact the maintainers privately
3. Allow reasonable time for a fix
4. Coordinate public disclosure timing

## Security Update History

### Version 1.0.0 (October 26, 2024)
- ✅ Initial implementation with security best practices
- ✅ XSS protection via HTML escaping
- ✅ Filename sanitization
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Client-side only architecture

## Conclusion

The Sora Watermark Remover tool has been designed with security as a priority:

✅ **No Critical Vulnerabilities**: All identified issues resolved
✅ **Security Best Practices**: Following industry standards
✅ **Privacy First**: Client-side only processing
✅ **Safe by Design**: Architecture prevents most attack vectors

The remaining CodeQL alerts are false positives related to safe blob URL usage. The tool is secure for production use.
